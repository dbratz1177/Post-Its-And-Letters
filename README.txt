Launch-u Host App

This part of the app is used to stitch together the engines into a functional integrated app.
It also houses the controller for static pages, sessions, authentication, and the user's homepage.
Rails Bricks created the initial layout and set up authentication and basic authorization with
Devise. All of these controllers can be inherited to add additional functionality and customization
to your needs.
